Title: Handling Class Imbalance in Random Forest with Resampling and Cost-Sensitive Techniques
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Haozhe Zeng [aut, cre]

Description: 
    This package provides tools for addressing class imbalance in binary classification problems 
    using Random Forest. It implements resampling techniques (SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE, undersampling), 
    cost-sensitive learning methods (Weighted Random Forest, EasyEnsemble), and hybrid approaches 
    to optimize model performance under imbalanced conditions. The package supports robust model 
    evaluation using F1-Score, Weighted Accuracy, Recall/Precision, G-Mean, and ROC AUC metrics.
